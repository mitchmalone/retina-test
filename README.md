MacBook Pro with Retina Test
===========

This is a simple web app that seeks to emulate the test that Apple use to check for faulty screens in the MacBook Pro with Retina.

To use the app simply go to [http://www.mitchmalone.name/retina-test/](http://www.mitchmalone.name/retina-test/) or clone the repo and feel free to run it locally. For best results open in Safari and run the test for 3-5 minutes in full screen mode.
