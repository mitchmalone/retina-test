MacBook Pro with Retina Test
===========

This is a simple web app that seeks to emulate the test that Apple use to check for faulty screens in the MacBook Pro with Retina.

To use the app simply clone the repo and run `index.html` locally using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For best results open in Firefox and run the test for 3-5 minutes in full screen mode.
